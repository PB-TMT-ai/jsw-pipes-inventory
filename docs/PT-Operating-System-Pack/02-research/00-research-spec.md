# Research effort: P&T Operating System — foundation research

Status: complete (briefs + synthesis delivered 2026-08-01)

## Goal

Exploratory research to ground a future "P&T Operating System" — a visibility / monitoring / deviation-highlighting / planning system for a **steel pipes & tubes** business. No system design or build decisions yet.

## Confirmed context (from grilling session, 2026-08-01)

- Segment: **steel pipes & tubes** (ERW / structural / GI, coil-fed tube mills). Comparable companies: APL Apollo, Tata Steel Tubes, JSW, Surya Roshni, Hi-Tech Pipes.
- Business elements: multiple plants, distributor network, sales teams; 250+ SKUs (75–80 core/distinct SKU families per the user).
- Flow of interest: distributor best estimates/orders → demand aggregation → planning → SKU-level campaign planning → (further steps to be defined once the first stages are established).
- Main objective: high visibility, monitoring, deviation highlighting, immaculate planning.

## Quality bar (user directive, 2026-08-01)

Not surface-level survey — **practically implementable**. Every mechanism covered must be extracted as implementable logic: inputs/data required, rule/formula/procedure, decision output, cadence — with worked numeric examples. A system designer must be able to draft module logic (product master, estimate cycle, forecast rollup, allocation, campaign sequencing, deviation engine) directly from the briefs. Sourced claims cited; synthesized rules labeled as such.

## Workstreams (all four confirmed)

1. **Industry planning flow & logics** → `briefs/01-planning-flow.md`
2. **Similar systems landscape** → `briefs/02-systems-landscape.md`
3. **Pipes & tubes domain expertise** → `briefs/03-domain-expertise.md`
4. **Deviation monitoring & KPIs** → `briefs/04-deviations-kpis.md`

Synthesis tying them together → `synthesis.md`

## Open terms to sharpen in a future session

- **Estimate vs Order vs Indent** — the user's phrasing "best estimate/orders from the distributor" conflates a forward-looking demand estimate with a confirmed purchase commitment. These must become distinct glossary terms before any flow design.
- **SKU vs SKU family** — "more than 250 SKUs … 75–80 different SKUs" suggests two levels (sellable variant vs size/family). Needs resolution.
